# üìä System Load Monitoring on macOS

## üîç Overview

This project collects, labels, and prepares real system telemetry data from macOS for use in Machine Learning (ML) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) applications, particularly for operating system scheduling simulations.

It includes:
- Data logging with Python (`psutil`)
- Creating synthetic workloads (CPU, memory, I/O, network)
- Auto-labeling system state
- Preprocessing & normalization
- Visualization

---

## üõ† Tools Used

- Python + `psutil`
- Shell (`yes > /dev/null &`) to simulate CPU load
- `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`
- macOS Terminal

---

## üß™ Data Collection Process

Data is logged in real-time every 5 seconds. Each entry includes:

- `timestamp`: Time of recording
- `cpu_percent`, `memory_percent`: System-level usage
- `pid`, `name`: Process info
- `cpu_process`, `memory_process`: Resource usage per process

## üì¶ Synthetic Workload Timeline

| Stage | Start | Activity                         | Label          |
|-------|-------|----------------------------------|----------------|
| 1     | 00:31 | System idle                      | idle           |
| 2     | 00:34 | 20x yes CPU stress               | high_cpu       |
| 3     | 00:38 | Open Chrome, Xcode               | high_mem       |
| 4     | 00:42 | Copy & zip large files           | disk_io        |
| 5     | 00:45 | Watch video, download file       | network_load   |
| 6     | 00:48 | Stop all apps ‚Üí idle again       | idle           |

## üßπ Data Preprocessing

- Rows with missing process info were removed
- Features normalized (`cpu_process`, `memory_process`) using `MinMaxScaler`
- Labels added automatically by comparing `timestamp` with known workload intervals

---

## üìà Visualization

The chart below shows how CPU usage per process changes over time, segmented by labeled workload phases:

## üìÅ Files

- `mac_syslog.csv`: Cleaned, labeled, normalized dataset
- `output.png`: Visualization image
- `log_system.py`: Python script to collect data using `psutil`
